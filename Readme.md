Here’s a README file for your **DonationTracker** project.

# DonationTracker

**DonationTracker** is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to allow users to donate Ether to various causes. The smart contract tracks the donations made to each cause and allows anyone to view the total donations received by a specific cause.

## Features

- **Donations**: Users can donate Ether to any cause by specifying the cause name.
- **Donation Tracking**: The platform tracks and displays the total donations made to each cause.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability.
- **Event Logging**: Donation details (donor, amount, cause, and total donations) are emitted as events for transparency and ease of tracking.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to deploy and interact with the **DonationTracker** smart contract.

### Prerequisites

1. **MetaMask**: Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a browser wallet for interacting with Ethereum.
2. **Ethereum Test Network**: Set up MetaMask to connect to an Ethereum test network (e.g., **Rinkeby**, **Ropsten**).
3. **Web3.js**: This frontend will use Web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## Smart Contract Overview

The **DonationTracker** smart contract is written in **Solidity** and has the following functions:

### Functions

1. **donateToCause(string calldata cause)**:

   - Allows users to donate Ether to a specific cause.
   - The total donations for that cause are updated on the blockchain.
   - Emits a `DonationMade` event, logging the donation.

2. **getTotalDonations(string calldata cause)**:
   - Allows users to view the total donations made to a specific cause.
   - Returns the total Ether donations for the specified cause.

### Events

- **DonationMade**:
  - Emitted whenever a donation is made.
  - Logs the donor’s address, the cause, the amount donated, and the total donations received by the cause.

---

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend of the **DonationTracker** uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with the **Web3.js** library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via **MetaMask**.

### Features:

- **Connect to MetaMask**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the contract.
- **Donate Ether**: Users can select a cause and donate Ether, with the transaction processed through the smart contract.
- **View Total Donations**: Users can input the name of a cause and view the total donations received by that cause.

---

## Steps to Deploy and Use the Smart Contract

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

You can deploy the **DonationTracker** smart contract to an Ethereum test network like **Rinkeby** or **Ropsten** using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or **Truffle**.

- Copy the contract code into Remix.
- Compile and deploy the contract.
- After deployment, copy the contract address.

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

The frontend can be set up using the following steps:

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and include Web3.js in it.
2. Use the Web3.js library to interact with the deployed contract using its ABI and contract address.
3. Implement the functionality to:
   - Connect to MetaMask.
   - Allow users to donate Ether to a cause.
   - Allow users to view the total donations for a specific cause.

### 3. Update the Contract Address

Once the contract is deployed, copy the **contract address** and update it in the frontend code so that users can interact with the correct deployed contract.

## Example Code for Frontend Interaction

Here’s an example of how you can set up your frontend using Web3.js:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Donation Tracker</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web3@1.3.5/dist/web3.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Donation Tracker</h1>
    <button id="connectButton">Connect MetaMask</button>
    <div id="donationSection">
      <h2>Donate to a Cause</h2>
      <input type="text" id="cause" placeholder="Enter Cause Name" />
      <input

        id="donationAmount"
        placeholder="Donation Amount (ETH)"
      />
      <button id="donateButton">Donate</button>
    </div>
    <div id="totalDonationsSection">
      <h2>View Total Donations for a Cause</h2>
      <input type="text" id="viewCause" placeholder="Enter Cause Name" />
      <button id="viewTotalButton">View Total Donations</button>
      <p id="totalDonationsDisplay"></p>
    </div>

    <script>
      const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with your deployed contract address
      const contractABI = YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI; // Replace with your contract ABI

      let web3;
      let contract;
      let userAccount;

      // Initialize Web3 and contract
      if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {

        contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
      } else {
        alert("Please install MetaMask to interact with the contract.");
      }

      // Connect to MetaMask
      document
        .getElementById("connectButton")
        .addEventListener("click", async () => {
          const accounts = await ethereum.request({
            method: "eth_requestAccounts",
          });
          userAccount = accounts[0];
          console.log("Connected account:", userAccount);
        });

      // Donate to a cause
      document
        .getElementById("donateButton")
        .addEventListener("click", async () => {
          const cause = document.getElementById("cause").value;
          const donationAmount =
            document.getElementById("donationAmount").value;
          if (cause && donationAmount > 0) {
            await contract.methods
              .donateToCause(cause)
              .send({
                from: userAccount,
                value: web3.utils.toWei(donationAmount, "ether"),
              });
          } else {
            alert("Please provide valid cause name and donation amount.");
          }
        });

      // View total donations for a cause
      document
        .getElementById("viewTotalButton")
        .addEventListener("click", async () => {
          const cause = document.getElementById("viewCause").value;
          if (cause) {
            const totalDonations = await contract.methods
              .getTotalDonations(cause)
              .call();
            document.getElementById(
              "totalDonationsDisplay"
            ).innerText = `Total Donations for ${cause}: ${web3.utils.fromWei(
              totalDonations,
              "ether"
            )} ETH`;
          } else {
            alert("Please provide a cause name.");
          }
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
